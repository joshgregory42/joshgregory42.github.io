CU Boulder offers a class called "[Aesthetics in Design](https://www.aesdes.org/)", offered at both the senior undergraduate and graduate levels. Throughout the course, I made several artifacts. What follows is a portfolio of the artifacts that I am most proud of. They can also be viewed on the website linked above, and they are copied over here for a more permanent home.

## Aesthetics Exporation - Minimalism

I have always appreciated design that simplifies complex tasks in a beautiful (but simple) way. I feel as though a lot of design can be distracting, but thoughtful and simple design can serve as a way to allow someone to focus on what is important to them.

The minimalism movement as a philosophy had its start in the early 19th century in the United States by the likes of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, who believed that "insight and enlightenment can be gained through solitude and simplicity". The modern style of minimalism, however, was heavily inspired by the Bauhaus School in Germany during the early [20th century](https://minimalism.co/articles/history-of-minimalism). It features a strong emphasis on basic shapes such as rectangles and circles. An example of this is in the Bauhaus logo itself, which was designed by Oskar Schlemmer in 1921.

We can see that this logo shows a face in side profile, however it uses only lines, squares, and circles. The color palette as well is also simple, just black and white. These shapes can also be seen in architecture. The most logical example of this is perhaps the Bauhaus School itself in Dessau, Germany:

Much like the Bauhaus logo, we can see that the building itself is composed almost entirely of simple colors (white, black, and gray with some red touches) as well as glass to allow for natural sunlight to enter the building.

One of the most influential figures in minimalism who brought the Bauhaus ideas into the mainstream is Deiter Rams. He is a German industrial designer that is known for his "Good design" principles that many minimalist (and non-minimalist) designers use to this day to assess the quality of their [designs](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/dieter-rams). Some of the rules he outlined are "is innovative", "is unobtrusive", "is as little design as possible", and "is long-lasting", among others. Some of his most famous works are the Vitsœ 620 Chair and the Braun ABW 30 clock, both shown below.

The Vitsœ 620 Chair is able to have multiple assembled into a sofa. The two screws on the bottom disconnect the armrest and allow for two chairs to be screwed together to form a sofa, with the armrest being attached at the end of the two couches that are now screwed together. Furthermore, the chair itself is designed to be extremely easy to be assembled and is made out of high-quality components. Both of these are factors that show the long-lasting and simple design advocated for by Rams.

The Braun ABW30 clock is also extremely simple. Much like the Bauhaus logo, it only has two colors and the arms are of two distinct sizes, making it easy to tell the time.

Both Dieter Rams and the Bauhaus school were inspirations for Jony Ive, the former Chief Design Officer at [Apple](https://gizmodo.com/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future-343641). Two examples of this are the original iPhone and the old MacBook Air model.

While both of these were groundbreaking and impressive machines when they were released, what I find most impressive and most telling about their aesthetic is that they still look good, 16 years later. To me, that is what good minimalism should do. Not only should the designs be made out of quality materials (i.e. metal and glass), but also be timeless.


## Upcycle Aesthetic: Organic Shapes and Knife Woodblocks

The knife storage solution in my apartment is currently precarious, to put things lightly. All of our knives are currently in a drawer in random orientations with knives of various lengths. They also happen to be somewhat near other cutlery, like forks and spoons, which means that it is a small miracle all of my roommates and I haven't seriously cut ourselves. I'm honestly too embarrassed to take an actual picture of our knife/cutlery drawer, but it looks like a messier version of this picture:

![A semi-messy knife drawer. [Source](https://www.cutco.com/learn/what-makes-knives-go-dull/](aesthetics/knives_messy.jpg){width=70%}

This problem led me to thinking about creating a knife block to store my knives. Not only would it solve a genuine problem I have, but it would also allow me to explore something that could have subtle design cues that I like while also being sustainable. The sustainable aspect of this knife block is the sourcing of the wood itself. I have a friend who works extensively with wood on various projects. As such, he has a significant amount of scrap wood that would otherwise be thrown away. Instead of discarding it, he and I discussed using the various scraps of wood to create a wood block. This would create a unique, one of one pattern for the knife block. Not only would this look different compared to other knife blocks, but it would also put a significant amount of wood to use that would otherwise be discarded.

The design of the knife block itself is something that I have given considerable thought to, even if some of the design changes that I want to make to it are subtle. There was an interview with Craig Federighi, Apple's head of software design, where he mentions that human faces have an lot of curves, so it makes sense to have the software reflect that. This can also be seen in other Apple-designed areas, such as the staircase railing design in Apple Park:

![Stair design in Apple Park. [Source](https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-park](aesthetics/apple_park_stairs.jpg){width=70%}

Most staircases have sharp edges, but these have a radius of curvature and there are very few harsh edges. This desire to erase perpendicular edges and create a knife block that looks organic is something that I am going to attempt to pull off.

The most differing aspect of my knife block will be that it will be made out of a single sanded piece of wood sandwiched together. Most (if not all) knife blocks are actually made with two pieces of wood, as can be seen here:

![A concentional wooden knife block. [Source](https://www.sierra.com/ja-henckels-international-everedge-knife-block-set-8-piece~p~5827n/](aesthetics/knife_block_regular.jpg){width=70%}

My design would get rid of this line, and instead feature one continuous line, from the top of the knife block to the waterfall edge to the base. The block would also not have the sharp angles that can be seen at the rear of this knife block, instead continuing the line from the rear until it meets the table that it rests on. The cut-outs for each of the knives, as well, would be rectangles with rounded corners instead of rectangles with perpendicular vertices. Again, while all of these design changes are subtle, I believe that (at least to me), this would increase the beauty of something as a knife block that most people don't give a second thought to.

## Upcycle Design Report

### Design Inspiration

As a brief recap, my Upcycle project is to use scrap/reused wood to create a knife block that is made to look like it is made out of a single block of wood as much as possible. The inspiration for a knife block specifically came from the fact that the knives I currently have are stored in a few drawers in various orientations, which scares me and isn't really safe. I also think it would be nice to have a knife block that I can add to as I get more knives, since right now I only have a few.

The image above is what most knife blocks currently look like. The main element that I wanted to change was how this knife block looks like there are two different pieces of wood glued together; one at the front and one at the rear. I don't like this unnecessary complexity, and believe that a minimalist aesthetic applied to this would involve both of these pieces of wood being infused into one piece, creating an uninterrupted line on the sides. This comes from some of my more organic inspirations, such as the minimalism from Dieter Rams and Jony Ive at Apple Park, an example of which is the organic shape of their stairs:

### Fabrication Process

The fabrication process started by first using a knife block that a friend already had and gathering some dimensions from there in order to gain some intuition on the spacing:

![Knife block that was used for dimensioning mine.](aesthetics/knife_block_used.jpeg){width=70%}

![Sketch of the knife block dimensions before fabrication began.](aesthetics/knife_block_dims.jpeg){width=70%}

Once the dimensions were gathered, the raw materials were obtained. A long scrap piece of oak was found and was cut into several pieces and glued together to create the overall frame of the knife block. You can see this in the following picture. If you look closely, you can see what looks like four wooden squares glued together (note the difference in grain direction, that's the giveaway):

![Glued knife block before the initial cuts.](aesthetics/wood_pre_cut.jpeg){width=70%}

The original plan was to cut several incisions similar to the one in the image above on either side of the wood and then frame it with more scrap wood. That was all fine and dandy until this happened:

![Side view of the knife block after making some of the knife holes.](aesthetics/knife_block_oops.jpeg){width=70%}

It might be hard to see, but the wood decided to split. I was going too fast and things started breaking. Not only that, the entire knife block split in half due to some of the wood glue not being able to set correctly. This meant that the entire thing had to be taken apart, sanded down, and then glued again. With a lot of clamps. Like more clamps than you've probably seen on something:

![Fixing the knife block after it decided to split itself apart.](aesthetics/knife_block_clamps.jpeg){width=70%}

The crazy number of clamps were used to ensure that there was enough even pressure throughout the wood to make sure that the glue would create a solid bond with the wood. This part is really key, since wood is porous and the pressure must be applied over the top of parallel wood grains. Otherwise the glue fails and the entire thing falls apart (again). This set overnight so that the same mistake wasn't repeated, and thankfully the glue dried and held.

![A joiner being used to create the angles and flat edges.](aesthetics/joiner.jpeg){width=70%}

Another part of this experience was working with a friend who is extremely experienced in woodworking. He helped me think through the design, showed me the tools we would need to use and how to operate them, and overall his thought process in looking at a completed product, deconstructing it, and then modifying it to the aesthetic that I was going for. Furthermore, I learned a lot about the sheer amount of time making something like this takes. It was about 12 hours of work over two whole days, not counting the time for the glue to dry, which would add another several hours. The end product, after it was glued and sanded, is something I'm pretty happy with:

![Steak knife view. The lighter piece of wood on the top of the front face is made out of birch.](aesthetics/steak_knives.jpeg){width=70%}

![](aesthetics/top_no_knives.jpeg){width=70%}

![It holds knives!](aesthetics/unstained.jpeg){width=70%}

The sanding process was also extremely satisfying. The wood got softer to the touch than I even knew possible, and I also found a piece of birch wood to use for the top portion of the front (that's the lighter band in the front view). I think it adds a nice splash of color, and when I go to stain the knife block it will add a nice contrast to the rest of the project.

While I didn't get the rounded corners and edges I was going for by the time this project was due, I am thinking of going in and adding them. That being said, I did get some feedback from some members of my pod that they actually liked the edges and how it lends to an angular feature to the knife block, similar to the angular features from the side. I hadn't really thought of this, but am going to keep the knife block on my counter for a few weeks as it is and see if I see it the same way, or if I do end up wanting to curve the edges.

I am also going to go in and stain the entire knife block. Professer Hertzberg recommended walnut oil, which seems really interesting and I think would add a nice color to the knife block and make it appear more finished.

Perhaps the best part was seeing the knife block actually hold knives! I had put it in so much work, and I was so nervous that the measurements would be correct, but for some reason the holes would either be too big or too small. But seeing the knives slide right in was really satisfying. This is definitely something I am going to use for (hopefully) years to come, and will hopefully get a lot of love :)
