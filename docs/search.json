My thesis is focusing on using vision transformers to more effectively extract cerebrovasculature that could lead to stroke. I have been a member of FLOWLab at CU Boulder for a few years, focusing on blood clots, stroke mechanics, and dveloping better computational tools to understand them.\nI am passionate about helping people and creating tools and technologies to improve the lives of those around me. Take a look around to see what I’ve been up to!\n\n\nEducation\nMaster of Science, Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder (2025)\nBachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering, minors in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder (2024)"
